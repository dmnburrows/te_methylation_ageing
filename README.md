# te_methylation_ageing

This repo is for the preprocessing and analysis of methylation marks over transposable elements across the lifespan in brain tissue, specifically on data using bisulfite sequencing and oxidative bisulfite sequencing to measure mC and hmC respectively. 

## What is this repo for?
* the processing of methylation datasets from human brain donors
* the construction of algorithms for quantifying methylation of TE families
* the analysis of transposable element methylation markers across the lifespan

## What does this repo contain?
* Modules contain functions for TE methylation analysis
* Accompanying ipynotebooks demonstrate how to use the modules
* shell scripts for running bioinformatics pipelines

## Modules


## Notebooks
